# 🚀 MarketDB: A Hybrid SQL & NoSQL Database for E-Commerce

![MarketDB Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/marketdb-banner)

## 🏆 Project Overview
MarketDB is a **hybrid database solution** integrating **SQL (MySQL)** for structured data and **NoSQL (MongoDB)** for high-performance, flexible storage. This system provides **optimized data retrieval, transaction processing, and analytics** for an **online marketplace**, enabling seamless interactions between buyers, sellers, and administrators.

🔹 **MySQL** handles relational data like Users, Orders, Payments, and Shipping.  
🔹 **MongoDB** stores unstructured data like Product Metadata, User Reviews, and Analytics.  
🔹 **Python-powered APIs** ensure efficient database communication and reporting.  
🔹 **Advanced indexing and query optimization** improve data retrieval performance.  
🔹 **ACID compliance in SQL** and **CAP theorem considerations in NoSQL** ensure data consistency and availability.  
 
🔹 **Sharding, Replication, and Load Balancing** ensure fault tolerance and scalability.

## 📖 Introduction
MarketDB integrates **MySQL for structured transactional data** and **MongoDB for flexible, unstructured content storage** to address scalability, consistency, and efficiency challenges in e-commerce databases.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
**Challenges in E-Commerce Databases:**
- 🚀 **Performance bottlenecks** in handling large-scale transactions.
- ⚡ **Scalability limitations** in traditional relational databases.
- 🔄 **Data inconsistency** between structured and unstructured data.
- 🔎 **Slow query performance** with complex joins and filtering.

**MarketDB Solution:**
✔ **SQL for relational data** (Users, Orders, Payments).  
✔ **NoSQL for flexible content storage** (Reviews, Analytics).  
✔ **Python-based APIs** for seamless database interactions.  
✔ **Optimized indexing & query tuning** for high-speed retrieval.  
✔ **ACID compliance in SQL, CAP theorem adherence in NoSQL**.  
✔ **Efficient use of normalization and denormalization** where necessary.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals & Objectives
✅ **Develop a dual-database architecture** integrating SQL & NoSQL.  
✅ **Design an optimized relational model** for e-commerce operations.  
✅ **Implement a flexible NoSQL model** for dynamic data storage.  
✅ **Enable Python-driven database access** for query execution and analysis.  
✅ **Ensure scalability, efficiency, and security** in transaction processing.  
✅ **Leverage indexing techniques** to speed up searches and aggregations.  
✅ **Use data replication and sharding** for enhanced fault tolerance.

## 🛠 Database Design
### 📂 Conceptual Model
_**(Add ER Diagram Here)**_

### 📊 Relational Model (MySQL)
_**(Add Relational Schema Image Here)**_
✔ **Entities:** Users, Sellers, Buyers, Products, Orders, Payments, Shipping.  
✔ **Relationships:** Foreign key constraints for referential integrity.  
✔ **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)** for eliminating redundancy.  
✔ **ACID compliance for transactional reliability**.  

### 📜 NoSQL Document Model (MongoDB)
_**(Add NoSQL Schema Image Here)**_
✔ **Collections:** User Reviews, Product Metadata, Analytics.  
✔ **Schema-less Design:** Adaptable structure for flexible data storage.  
✔ **Sharding & Replication:** Ensuring horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.  
✔ **Aggregation pipeline for real-time analytics**.  

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance
✔ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for enforcing security.  
✔ **SQL Injection Prevention** using parameterized queries.  
✔ **Data Encryption (AES, RSA, TDE)** for protecting sensitive data.  
✔ **Audit Logs & Monitoring** for tracking database activities.  
✔ **Backup & Disaster Recovery Plans** to ensure data availability.  

---

## 📊 Insights & Analytics
✔ **Sales Trend Analysis** using SQL aggregation functions.  
✔ **User Behavior & Purchase Patterns** from MongoDB analytics.  
✔ **Seller Performance Dashboards** via Python visualization tools.  
✔ **Customer Review Sentiment Analysis** for business insights.
