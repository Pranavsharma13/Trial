# 🚀 MarketDB: A Hybrid SQL & NoSQL Database for E-Commerce

![MarketDB Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/marketdb-banner)

## 🏆 Project Overview
MarketDB is a **hybrid database solution** integrating **SQL (MySQL)** for structured data and **NoSQL (MongoDB)** for high-performance, flexible storage. This system provides **optimized data retrieval, transaction processing, and analytics** for an **online marketplace**, enabling seamless interactions between buyers, sellers, and administrators.

🔹 **MySQL** handles relational data like Users, Orders, Payments, and Shipping.  
🔹 **MongoDB** stores unstructured data like Product Metadata, User Reviews, and Analytics.  
🔹 **Python-powered APIs** ensure efficient database communication and reporting.  
🔹 **Advanced indexing and query optimization** improve data retrieval performance.  
🔹 **ACID compliance in SQL** and **CAP theorem considerations in NoSQL** ensure data consistency and availability.  
🔹 **Sharding, Replication, and Load Balancing** ensure fault tolerance and scalability.

## 📖 Introduction
MarketDB integrates **MySQL for structured transactional data** and **MongoDB for flexible, unstructured content storage** to address scalability, consistency, and efficiency challenges in e-commerce databases.

### **🔹 Database Design & Implementation**
✔ **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling** for conceptual database design.  
✔ **Relational Model (MySQL)** for structured data with normalization.  
✔ **NoSQL Document Storage (MongoDB)** for product metadata, reviews, and analytics.  
✔ **Indexing (B-tree, Hash, Composite, Text, Geospatial)** to optimize query performance.  
✔ **Referential Integrity & Constraints** for maintaining data consistency in SQL.  
✔ **Sharding & Replication** for load distribution and fault tolerance.  

### **🔹 SQL Features Used**
✔ **Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS JOIN)** for complex data retrieval.  
✔ **Stored Procedures & Triggers** for automation and transaction handling.  
✔ **Query Optimization (EXPLAIN ANALYZE, Execution Plan Analysis)** to enhance performance.  
✔ **ACID Transactions** ensuring atomicity and consistency.  
✔ **Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY)** for analytical queries.  
✔ **Materialized Views & Common Table Expressions (CTE)** for efficient data access.  

### **🔹 NoSQL Features Used**
✔ **Dynamic Schema Design** for flexible data structure.  
✔ **Aggregation Pipeline & MapReduce** for complex analytics.  
✔ **Sharding & Horizontal Scaling** for high-performance distribution.  
✔ **Text and Geospatial Indexing** for fast lookups.  
✔ **Schema Validation in MongoDB** to enforce structure where necessary.  
✔ **CAP Theorem Considerations** for optimizing availability and partition tolerance.  

### **🔹 Performance Optimization & Query Tuning**
✔ **Query Execution Plan Analysis** to detect bottlenecks.  
✔ **Read & Write Optimization** using indexing and caching.  
✔ **Batch Processing & Bulk Inserts** for efficient data handling.  
✔ **Parallel Query Execution** to speed up operations.  
✔ **Partitioning & Archiving Strategies** to manage large datasets.  

### **🔹 Security & Compliance**
✔ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enforce security.  
✔ **SQL Injection Prevention** using parameterized queries.  
✔ **Data Encryption (AES, RSA, TDE)** for secure storage.  
✔ **Audit Logs & Monitoring** for tracking database activities.  
✔ **Backup & Disaster Recovery Plans** to ensure data safety.  

### **🔹 Scalability & Distributed Systems**
✔ **Database Replication (Master-Slave, Master-Master, Multi-Region)** for high availability.  
✔ **Auto-Sharding & Load Balancing** to distribute workloads.  
✔ **Federated Database Queries** for cross-database interactions.  
✔ **Multi-Tenancy Design** for scalable SaaS applications.  

### **🔹 Insights & Analytics**
✔ **Sales Trend Analysis** using SQL aggregation functions.  
✔ **User Behavior & Purchase Patterns** from MongoDB data analytics.  
✔ **Seller Performance Dashboards** via Python visualization tools.  
✔ **Customer Review Sentiment Analysis** for business insights.
